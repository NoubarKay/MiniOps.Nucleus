**MiniOps.Nucleus** is a **high-performance, ultra-lightweight request metrics collector and real-time dashboard** for .NET applications. With a footprint of just **26 KB**, it provides a minimal yet powerful solution for monitoring your application's request traffic without adding overhead.

It captures key request metrics ‚Äî including duration, status codes, paths, and timestamps ‚Äî and stores them in a **thread-safe, in-memory queue** for **non-blocking, high-speed writes**. Logs are **flushed in batches** to your database to reduce write operations and automatically **cleaned up** based on configurable retention settings.

MiniOps.Nucleus also includes an **early-preview SignalR-powered dashboard** for real-time visualization of request patterns, making it easy to monitor performance, spot spikes, and identify bottlenecks. Its lightweight design and simple integration make it ideal for **APIs, and high-throughput web applications**.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîé **Request Metrics Tracking**  
  Collects request duration, status codes, paths, and timestamps.

- üßµ **Concurrent In-Memory Store**  
  Built with a thread-safe concurrent queue for **non-blocking, high-speed writes**.

- üíæ **Batch Inserts & Deletes**  
  Flushes requests to the database in batches, reducing write overhead. Deletes old rows automatically to reduce DB bloat.

- üìä **Dashboard (Early Preview)**  
  - Real-time streaming chart of requests (via SignalR).  
  - Currently, **only the request graph is implemented**.  
  - Upcoming panels: status breakdown, latency distribution, and more.

- ‚ö° **Ultra Lightweight**  
  With a **26 KB footprint**, MiniOps.Nucleus is one of the lightest metrics solutions you can add to your project.

## Getting Started

Quick start
Register Nucleus in DI and configure options:
```csharp
// Register Nucleus Core
builder.Services.AddNucleus(op =>
{
    op.DatabaseType = NucleusDatabaseTypes.SQLServer; // SQLServer
    op.ConnectionString = "<your-connection-string>";
    op.SchemaName = "Nucleus";           // optional, default "Nucleus"
    op.LogTTLSeconds = 60;               // delete logs older than 60s
    op.BatchFlushIntervalSeconds = 1;    // flush in-memory logs every 1s
    op.SeedDatabase = true;              // auto-create schema/table if needed
});

var app = builder.Build();

//...

// Start Nucleus (seeding + background services)
await app.UseNucleus();

app.Run();
```
That‚Äôs it‚Äîrequests flowing through the app are tracked and written to your database in batches. Old rows are purged automatically based on LogTTLSeconds.

| `DatabaseType`              | `NucleusDatabaseTypes` | ‚Äî           | The type of database MiniOps will use. Supported: SqlServer (More to come)                                          |
| `ConnectionString`          | `string`               | `""`        | The connection string for the selected database                                                                     |
| `LogTTLSeconds`             | `int`                  | `1`         | Time-to-live for request logs, in seconds. Expired logs are deleted automatically by the background cleanup service |
| `BatchFlushIntervalSeconds` | `float`                | `1`         | How often, in seconds, the background flush service writes accumulated logs to the database                         |

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Is it thread-safe?**  
Yes, MiniOps.Nucleus uses a ConcurrentQueue for non-blocking, thread-safe writes.

**Can it work without a database?**  
Currently, a database is required for batch inserts.

**Which databases are supported?**  
SQLServer is fully supported; PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite support coming soon.

**Does it impact app performance?**  
It is designed to be lightweight and minimal, with <1ms overhead per request.
